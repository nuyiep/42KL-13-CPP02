The Orthodox Canonical Class Form
(A class should have the following 4 items)
- Default constructor
	- does not take any arguments
	- used internally to initialize objects 
		and data members when no other value is available
- Copy constructor
	- used in the implementation of 				call-by-value parameters
- Assignment operator
	- used to assign one value to another
- Destructor
	- invoked when an object is deleted
